This is a rough list of my favorite deep learning resources. It has been useful to me for learning how to do deep learning, I use it for revisiting topics or for reference.
I ([Guillaume Chevalier](https://github.com/guillaume-chevalier)) have built this list and got through all of the content listed here, carefully.

## Trends

Here are the all-time [Google Trends](https://www.google.ca/trends/explore?date=all&q=machine%20learning,deep%20learning,data%20science,computer%20programming), from 2004 up to now, September 2017:
<p align="center">

</p>

You might also want to look at Andrej Karpathy's [new post](https://medium.com/@karpathy/a-peek-at-trends-in-machine-learning-ab8a1085a106) about trends in Machine Learning research.

I believe that Deep learning is the key to make computers think more like humans, and has a lot of potential. Some hard automation tasks can be solved easily with that while this was impossible to achieve earlier with classical algorithms.

Moore's Law about exponential progress rates in computer science hardware is now more affecting GPUs than CPUs because of physical limits on how tiny an atomic transistor can be. We are shifting toward parallel architectures
[[read more](https://www.quora.com/Does-Moores-law-apply-to-GPUs-Or-only-CPUs)]. Deep learning exploits parallel architectures as such under the hood by using GPUs. On top of that, deep learning algorithms may use Quantum Computing and apply to machine-brain interfaces in the future.

I find that the key of intelligence and cognition is a very interesting subject to explore and is not yet well understood. Those technologies are promising.

<a name="other" />

### Other

- [ProjectionNet: Learning Efficient On-Device Deep Networks Using Neural Projections](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.00630) - Replace word embeddings by word projections in your deep neural networks, which doesn't require a pre-extracted dictionnary nor storing embedding matrices. 
- [Self-Governing Neural Networks for On-Device Short Text Classification](http://aclweb.org/anthology/D18-1105) - This paper is the sequel to the ProjectionNet just above. The SGNN is elaborated on the ProjectionNet, and the optimizations are detailed more in-depth (also see my [attempt to reproduce the paper in code](https://github.com/guillaume-chevalier/SGNN-Self-Governing-Neural-Networks-Projection-Layer) and watch [the talks' recording](https://vimeo.com/305197775)).
- [Matching Networks for One Shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04080) - Classify a new example from a list of other examples (without definitive categories) and with low-data per classification task, but lots of data for lots of similar classification tasks - it seems better than siamese networks. To sum up: with Matching Networks, you can optimize directly for a cosine similarity between examples (like a self-attention product would match) which is passed to the softmax directly. I guess that Matching Networks could probably be used as with negative-sampling softmax training in word2vec's CBOW or Skip-gram without having to do any context embedding lookups.

- [Attention Mechanisms in Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) - IGGG](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuvRWevJMZ4) - A talk for a reading group on attention mechanisms (Paper: Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate).
- [Tensor Calculus and the Calculus of Moving Surfaces](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlXfTHzgMRULkodlIEqfgTS-H1AY_bNtq) - Generalize properly how Tensors work, yet just watching a few videos already helps a lot to grasp the concepts.
- [Deep Learning & Machine Learning (Advanced topics)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlp-GWNOd6m4C_-9HxuHg2_ZeI2Yzwwqt) - A list of videos about deep learning that I found interesting or useful, this is a mix of a bit of everything.
- [Signal Processing Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlp-GWNOd6m6gSz0wIcpvl4ixSlS-HEmr) - A YouTube playlist I composed about DFT/FFT, STFT and the Laplace transform - I was mad about my software engineering bachelor not including signal processing classes (except a bit in the quantum physics class).
- [Computer Science](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlp-GWNOd6m7vLOsW20xAJ81-65C-Ys6k) - Yet another YouTube playlist I composed, this time about various CS topics.
- [Siraj's Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A/videos?view=0&sort=p&flow=grid) - Siraj has entertaining, fast-paced video tutorials about deep learning.
- [Two Minute Papers' Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/keeroyz/videos?sort=p&view=0&flow=grid) - Interesting and shallow overview of some research papers, for example about WaveNet or Neural Style Transfer.
- [Geoffrey Hinton interview](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/lecture/dcm5r/geoffrey-hinton-interview) - Andrew Ng interviews Geoffrey Hinton, who talks about his research and breaktroughs, and gives advice for students.

## Misc. Hubs & Links

- [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/news) - Maybe how I discovered ML - Interesting trends appear on that site way before they get to be a big deal.
- [DataTau](http://www.datatau.com/) - This is a hub similar to Hacker News, but specific to data science.
- [Naver](http://www.naver.com/) - This is a Korean search engine - best used with Google Translate, ironically. Surprisingly, sometimes deep learning search results and comprehensible advanced math content shows up more easily there than on Google search.
- [Arxiv Sanity Preserver](http://www.arxiv-sanity.com/) - arXiv browser with TF/IDF features.
